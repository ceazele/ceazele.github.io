I'm Lyle! I'm a senior at Stanford University studying economics and computer science theory. My main research interests are in market design and social and economic networks. This summer, I was an intern at Microsoft Research New England. I am continuing work with Sr. Principal Researcher [Markus Mobius](https://www.markusmobius.org/) to build mathematical models of learning in social networks. I'm also working on an honors thesis modeling the joint relationship between migration and informal risk-sharing in social networks in the developing world, advised by [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://stanford.edu/~arungc/)

Previously, I worked with professor [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) of the Stanford MS&E Department evaluating the effect of history representation on LLM agent behavior in a network routing game. I'm presenting the paper at the EC '25 Information Economics and Large Language Models Workshop in July.
