I'm Lyle! I'm a junior at Stanford University studying economics and computer science theory. My main research interests are in market design and social and economic networks. I'm currently rotating with professor [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) of the Stanford MS&E Department.

I'm an incoming intern at Microsoft Research New England in summer '25! I'll be mentored by [Markus Mobius](https://www.markusmobius.org/).
