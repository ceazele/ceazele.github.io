### Abstract

We describe practical, lightweight algorithmic solutions for the problem of one-sided
matching with dynamic ordinal preferences and multiple capacities. In particular, we
focus on amusement park scheduling where guests have preferences over rides they
wish to experience and rides have limited capacity in each time period. We explore
sequential variants of the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and Probabilistic Serial
(PS) mechanisms, and we experimentally validate their efficiency using a simulation
calibrated to ride capacity and wait time data from Disneyland.

### Term Project

This paper was our term project for ECON 285 at Stanford in Fall 2024. Theme parks are a personal hobby of mine, so it was very gratifying to unite my passion for market design with my love of theme parks! You can find a link to the PDF [here](https://lylegoodyear.com/assets/pdf/ECON_285_Final_Project.pdf). Thank you to [thrill-data.com](https://www.thrill-data.com/) and [darkridedatabase.com](https://darkridedatabase.com/) for providing the data used in the paper.
