### Abstract
Understanding the world and explaining it with scientific theories is a central aspiration of artificial intelligence research. Proposing theories, designing experiments to test them, and revising them based on data are fundamental to scientific discovery. Despite the significant promise of LLM-based scientific agents, no benchmarks systematically test LLMsâ€™ ability to propose scientific models, collect experimental data, and revise them in light of new data. We introduce BoxingGym, a systematic benchmark with 10 environments for evaluating both experimental design (e.g., collecting data to test a scientific theory) and model discovery (e.g., proposing and revising scientific theories).

### Key Contributions
- A systematic benchmark for evaluating language models in experimental design and model discovery.
- Integration of probabilistic modeling to simulate real-world scientific environments.
- Introduction of metrics such as Expected Information Gain (EIG) for experimental evaluation.
- Communication-based evaluation where agents explain models to novices.
